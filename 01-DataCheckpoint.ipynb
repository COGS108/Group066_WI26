    "The Google Play Store is the top distributor of downloadable content for Android devices. Run by Google as Android's official app store, it offers apps, games, books, movies, TV, and other media<sup><a href=\"#ref1\">1</a></sup>. As of 2024, the Google Play Store offered approximately 264,000 mobile games ranging across genres like Action, Puzzle, and RPG<sup><a href=\"#ref2\">2</a></sup>. Within this ecosystem, top chart rankings play an important role in influencing which games users actually see and download. Higher ranked games receive more visibility in lists, search results, and curated sections, which in turn increases the likelihood that users will click through and install them<sup><a href=\"#ref3\">3</a></sup>. However, since Google does not disclose its full algorithm behind rankings, it remains unclear which measurable performance metrics, such as install volume, rating averages, or review counts, most strongly predict a game's chart position<sup><a href=\"#ref3\">3</a></sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our own experience scrolling through the Play Store, we noticed that we almost always check the star rating and number of reviews before downloading a game. If an app has a high average rating and thousands of reviews, it just feels more trustworthy than one with barely any feedback. So, we hypothesize that review count and average star rating will be the features most strongly correlated with a game's ranking. With hundreds of thousands of games competing for attention on the Play Store, pinpointing the very factors that increase the attraction of games will help game developers to focus their resources on improving in those specific areas instead of guessing what might work. This gap motivates our analysis: We seek to identify which quantitative signals in the Play Store data correlate most closely with ranking, thereby shedding light on the factors that likely drive discoverability in this marketplace. The \"Top Games on Google Play Store\" dataset provides rankings for the top 100 games across multiple genres, allowing us to analyze whether the relative importance of these predictive factors varies significantly between categories like Action, Puzzle, and RPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior studies indicate that publishers' prior release volume, intragenre ranking, consumer ratings, and review volume jointly drive high levels of game downloads, with the influence of any single information cue varying depending on the presence of other coexisting cues<sup><a href=\"#ref4\">4</a></sup>. Complementary research using TAM and IDT based feature selection methods further shows that mobile game downloads are shaped by both usability perceptions, such as perceived ease of use and usefulness, and diffusion-related factors, including visibility, trialability, and social communication channels<sup><a href=\"#ref5\">5</a></sup>. Together, these findings suggest that download performance emerges from interacting quantitative and contextual signals, a premise that directly informs our investigation of how such signals translate into genre specific ranking outcomes on the Google Play Store and similar app distribution platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Google Play Store project<sup><a href=\"#ref6\">6</a></sup>, something that we could incorporate into our project are the different graphs that are present. The bar plot that outlines the number of paid and free apps based on category is very useful to see if the category in particular affects the ranking. The project also does a great job of looking at how ratings differ between paid and free apps. This is something that we could also incorporate into our project and see how pricing affects ranking. The correlation matrix is also useful since we are trying to figure out which features strongly influence rankings and this matrix summarizes it well by finding the correlation between ranking and other features. From the app store project<sup><a href=\"#ref7\">7</a></sup>, something that we could incorporate into our project is making a pipeline since that is nice especially if we want new unclean and untidy data for prediction to go through the same processes that we undertook for data cleaning/preprocessing in our project since that would make sure that the new data is fit for modeling and prediction. There were different ML models used like linear regression, SVM regression, polynomial regression etc. and their RMSE were compared, this is also nice if we want to see how each model performs on the validation set and use the best one later for the test set.\n",

    "**Number of observations:** 1,730  \n",
    "**Number of variables:** 15\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of variables relevant to the project\n",
    "\n",
    "- **rank:** An ordinal variable that measures the game’s position within its genre-specific Top 100 chart (e.g., 1 = highest ranked). This is the main outcome variable for our analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **total ratings:** A quantitative variable representing the total number of user ratings a game has received on the Google Play Store. Used to assess whether engagement volume significantly predicts a game's rank.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **installs:** An ordinal variable representing the game’s install milestone (e.g., 1M, 5M, 10M, etc.). This is used to evaluate whether overall popularity determines chart ranking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **average rating:** An ordinal variable representing the Play Store’s displayed average rating, rounded to the nearest integer (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5). Used to measure perceived quality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **growth (30 days):** A quantitative (%) variable measuring the percent increase in total ratings over the last 30 days.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **growth (60 days):** A quantitative (%) variable measuring the percent increase in total ratings over the last 60 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **5 star ratings:** A quantitative variable representing the game’s number of 5 star ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 star ratings:** A quantitative variable representing the game’s number of 4 star ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 star ratings:** A quantitative variable representing the game’s number of 3 star ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 star ratings:** A quantitative variable representing the game’s number of 2 star ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 star ratings:** A quantitative variable representing the game’s number of 1 star ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **price:** A quantitative variable representing the price of the game on the Google Play Store.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **category:** A categorical (nominal) variable representing the genre classification of the game (e.g., Action, Puzzle, Strategy, Casual). Used for analyzing differences in predictive features across genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptions of any dataset shortcomings relevant to the project\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset has several limitations that may affect statistical analysis. First, installs are recorded as milestone categories (e.g., “1M+” or “10M+”) rather than exact counts, which reduces precision when converting them into numeric values for modeling. Second, the dataset is cross-sectional and represents only a single snapshot in time, so it cannot capture dynamic changes in rank, installs, or growth, nor establish causal relationships.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also potential multicollinearity between installs and total ratings, since games with more downloads tend to accumulate more ratings. This may complicate regression interpretation and affect the relative importance of predictors. Finally, the dataset does not include other important ranking factors, such as revenue or user retention, which could result in omitted variable bias. Despite these limitations, the dataset is suitable for exploring predictive features of rank within the genre-specific Top 100 charts, which aligns with the research question.\n"

    "### Top Games on Google Play Store \n",
    "This dataset contains the top 100 ranked Android games from each of 17 Google Play Store game categories (Action, Puzzle, Casino, etc.), totaling 1,730 rows before cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total ratings** is an integer count of how many users have left a star rating for the game. In this dataset it ranges from ~33,000 to ~86 million (Garena Free Fire). The median is about 430,000. To put that in context, a game with 100K ratings is reasonably well-known; a game with 1M+ ratings is a mainstream hit; and anything above 10M is a global phenomenon (e.g. PUBG, Free Fire, Subway Surfers). This metric is the best proxy we have for a game's overall popularity and user engagement, since actual download counts are bucketed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installs** are reported as coarse string buckets — \"100.0 k\", \"1.0 M\", \"10.0 M\", \"100.0 M\", etc. — with only 9 distinct levels across the whole dataset. Nearly half of all games (47%) sit in the 10.0 M bucket, so this variable has extremely low resolution (i.e. a game listed as \"10.0 M\" installs could have anywhere from 10 million to 49.9 million actual installs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average rating** is reported as an integer — the only values present are 2, 3, and 4. This is the Play Store's displayed rating rounded to the nearest whole number, which destroys almost all signals (91% of games show a 4, 9% show a 3, and exactly one game shows a 2). This column is essentially useless for any comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth (30 days) and growth (60 days)** represent the percentage increase in total ratings over the last 30 and 60 days, respectively. Typical values are small: the median 30-day growth is just 0.5%, reflecting the steady trickle of ratings that established games receive. Values of 5–10% suggest a game gaining meaningful momentum (perhaps from a marketing push). However, a handful of entries show absurd values—one game reports 227,106% 30-day growth—which almost certainly means it went from near-zero ratings to some modest number, making the percentage astronomically large despite a small absolute change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Star rating breakdowns (5-star through 1-star counts)** give the raw count of ratings at each level. These are highly correlated with total ratings (r > 0.93 for all five), since bigger games simply get more of everything. What's more analytically interesting is the ratio — for instance, a game where 1-star ratings make up 15%+ of its total (like Garena Free Fire at ~14.5%) signals polarizing quality or aggressive monetization that frustrates a vocal minority, even if the weighted average looks fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The price** is in US dollars. The overwhelming majority of games (99.6%) are free; only 7 paid games appear in the dataset, ranging from \\\\$0.99 to \\$7.49. This reflects the reality of the mobile gaming market: the top charts are dominated by free-to-play titles that monetize through ads and in-app purchases rather than upfront cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key consideration for this dataset is that it includes only games ranked within the Top 100 of each genre. While this aligns with the focus of the research question, it means the dataset does not capture games outside the top charts, so any conclusions are specific to high-performing titles and may not apply to lower-ranked or newly released games. Additionally, because the sample includes only successful games, some variables, such as average rating, show limited variation, which could affect the statistical inference of their predictive power. Finally, the ranking system itself may incorporate factors not captured in the dataset, such as proprietary algorithms or internal promotion, which could influence rank independently of measurable metrics like installs, ratings, or growth. Despite these limitations, the dataset remains appropriate for analyzing the relative importance of quantitative features in predicting rank within genre-specific Top 100 charts, which is the focus of this study.\n",

    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our dataset only includes the top 100 ranked games per genre, which introduces significant selection bias. By excluding games ranked below 100, we systematically omit indie games, newer releases, and potentially diverse developers who haven't broken into the top charts. This could skew our findings toward characteristics of already-successful games with substantial marketing budgets, potentially reinforcing the advantage of established publishers. We acknowledge this limitation and will interpret our results as applicable to high-ranking games specifically, rather than generalizing to the entire Play Store ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> Our analysis focuses on quantitative metrics visible to users (ratings, installs, growth), but we recognize we lack perspective from game developers who understand the internal factors affecting rankings. Additionally, we do not account for qualitative factors like gameplay innovation, artistic merit, or accessibility features that may influence user satisfaction but not be captured in star ratings. To partially address this, we reviewed existing literature on mobile game success factors and will acknowledge that our statistical model captures correlation, not necessarily the causal mechanisms developers could control.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> The growth metrics (30-day and 60-day) may favor newer games with volatile early trajectories over established titles with stable user bases. The ordinal install milestones (e.g., \"1M+\", \"10M+\") compress continuous variation, potentially masking meaningful differences. We will examine correlations stratified by genre to identify where these biases most affect our conclusions.\n",

    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> We commit to transparent reporting of our findings, including null or weak correlations that do not support our hypothesis. When presenting visualizations, we will use appropriate axis scales to avoid exaggerating effects and include confidence intervals or error bars where applicable. \n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> We will maintain a well-documented analysis pipeline using Jupyter notebooks with detailed comments explaining each preprocessing step, statistical test, and modeling decision. Our code will be version-controlled using Git, and we will preserve the exact dataset version (including download timestamp) to ensure others can replicate our findings.\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> Our primary metric is rank (1–100), which treats the difference between rank 1 and 2 as equivalent to the difference between rank 99 and 100. This may be inappropriate if the statistical gap between top-ranked games is actually larger than between lower-ranked games. We will consider alternative formulations, such as log-rank transformations or treating rank as an ordinal rather than continuous variable.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> For each feature (total ratings, average rating, installs, growth rates), we will be able to explain in plain language: \"A one-standard-deviation increase in total ratings is associated with a 5-position improvement in ranking, holding other factors constant.\" If we use regularization or feature selection, we will explain why certain variables were excluded from the final model.\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> We will explicitly state that our model identifies correlates of ranking, not causal factors that developers can manipulate to guarantee success. We will also note that our analysis is based on a single time-point snapshot, so we cannot infer how rankings change over time or how seasonal factors (holidays, game launches) affect the relationships we observe. \n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?"
