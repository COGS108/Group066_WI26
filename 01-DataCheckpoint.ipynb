    "The Google Play Store is the top distributor of downloadable content for Android devices. Run by Google as Android's official app store, it offers apps, games, books, movies, TV, and other media<sup><a href=\"#ref1\">1</a></sup>. As of 2024, the Google Play Store offered approximately 264,000 mobile games ranging across genres like Action, Puzzle, and RPG<sup><a href=\"#ref2\">2</a></sup>. Within this ecosystem, top chart rankings play an important role in influencing which games users actually see and download. Higher ranked games receive more visibility in lists, search results, and curated sections, which in turn increases the likelihood that users will click through and install them<sup><a href=\"#ref3\">3</a></sup>. However, since Google does not disclose its full algorithm behind rankings, it remains unclear which measurable performance metrics, such as install volume, rating averages, or review counts, most strongly predict a game's chart position<sup><a href=\"#ref3\">3</a></sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our own experience scrolling through the Play Store, we noticed that we almost always check the star rating and number of reviews before downloading a game. If an app has a high average rating and thousands of reviews, it just feels more trustworthy than one with barely any feedback. So, we hypothesize that review count and average star rating will be the features most strongly correlated with a game's ranking. With hundreds of thousands of games competing for attention on the Play Store, pinpointing the very factors that increase the attraction of games will help game developers to focus their resources on improving in those specific areas instead of guessing what might work. This gap motivates our analysis: We seek to identify which quantitative signals in the Play Store data correlate most closely with ranking, thereby shedding light on the factors that likely drive discoverability in this marketplace. The \"Top Games on Google Play Store\" dataset provides rankings for the top 100 games across multiple genres, allowing us to analyze whether the relative importance of these predictive factors varies significantly between categories like Action, Puzzle, and RPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior studies indicate that publishers' prior release volume, intragenre ranking, consumer ratings, and review volume jointly drive high levels of game downloads, with the influence of any single information cue varying depending on the presence of other coexisting cues<sup><a href=\"#ref4\">4</a></sup>. Complementary research using TAM and IDT based feature selection methods further shows that mobile game downloads are shaped by both usability perceptions, such as perceived ease of use and usefulness, and diffusion-related factors, including visibility, trialability, and social communication channels<sup><a href=\"#ref5\">5</a></sup>. Together, these findings suggest that download performance emerges from interacting quantitative and contextual signals, a premise that directly informs our investigation of how such signals translate into genre specific ranking outcomes on the Google Play Store and similar app distribution platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Google Play Store project<sup><a href=\"#ref6\">6</a></sup>, something that we could incorporate into our project are the different graphs that are present. The bar plot that outlines the number of paid and free apps based on category is very useful to see if the category in particular affects the ranking. The project also does a great job of looking at how ratings differ between paid and free apps. This is something that we could also incorporate into our project and see how pricing affects ranking. The correlation matrix is also useful since we are trying to figure out which features strongly influence rankings and this matrix summarizes it well by finding the correlation between ranking and other features. From the app store project<sup><a href=\"#ref7\">7</a></sup>, something that we could incorporate into our project is making a pipeline since that is nice especially if we want new unclean and untidy data for prediction to go through the same processes that we undertook for data cleaning/preprocessing in our project since that would make sure that the new data is fit for modeling and prediction. There were different ML models used like linear regression, SVM regression, polynomial regression etc. and their RMSE were compared, this is also nice if we want to see how each model performs on the validation set and use the best one later for the test set.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "> Our dataset only includes the top 100 ranked games per genre, which introduces significant selection bias. By excluding games ranked below 100, we systematically omit indie games, newer releases, and potentially diverse developers who haven't broken into the top charts. This could skew our findings toward characteristics of already-successful games with substantial marketing budgets, potentially reinforcing the advantage of established publishers. We acknowledge this limitation and will interpret our results as applicable to high-ranking games specifically, rather than generalizing to the entire Play Store ecosystem.\n",

    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> Our analysis focuses on quantitative metrics visible to users (ratings, installs, growth), but we recognize we lack perspective from game developers who understand the internal factors affecting rankings. Additionally, we do not account for qualitative factors like gameplay innovation, artistic merit, or accessibility features that may influence user satisfaction but not be captured in star ratings. To partially address this, we reviewed existing literature on mobile game success factors and will acknowledge that our statistical model captures correlation, not necessarily the causal mechanisms developers could control.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?"

    "- We will use Discord as our primary means of communication. Responses should be within 24 hours. We will meet every Wednesday at Geisel at 5 PM unless notified otherwise through Discord.\n",

    "- We will communicate in a supportive tone with each other. Every message should be responded to. If there is no response needed, always like the message. We will be inclusive of all opinions; no opinion should be rejected without being heard. To express disagreement, we will start with “I personally think.”\n",

    "- Everyone is expected to do a little bit of everything. Since we all have different strengths, members should be proactive in their area of expertise. Always reach out for help if there is difficulty. Communicate openly if work needs to be split differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a deadline cannot be met, notify the group as soon as possible (at least 36 hours before the deadline). The team will come together to figure out a solution. We commit to being understanding and supportive, with no pressure in communicating these situations. Each member has two chances to request deadline flexibility.\n",
